GPlugin uses hgflow[1] for development.  All development takes place on the
develop branch which leaves default to be a stable release clone.  All long
term feature/bug fix work should take place on a feature branch that when
closed, gets merged to develop.

Releases are forked from develop and create a new branch for any testing/bug
fixes.  When a release is deemed done, it's merged back into develop and into
default.  hgflow takes care of all of this for us.
