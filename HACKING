GPlugin uses hgflow[1] for development.  All development takes place on the
develop branch which leaves default to be a clean branching point.  All long
term feature/bug fix work should take place on a feature branch that when
closed, gets merged to develop.

Release fork from develop and create a new branch for any testing/bug fixes.
When a release is deemed done, it's merged into default.
